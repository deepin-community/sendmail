<P>Hopefully we passed the correct options to the Amavis configure
script so that when we install it, the Debian file system policy
won't be violated. That would be bad karma. Create a user named "
amavis"</P>
<P>with:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
useradd amavis
</PRE>
</P>
<P>From the amavis-sourcecode-directory type:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
make install
</PRE>
</P>
<P>If everythiny worked, the install script should have</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>copied the amavisd perl script to /usr/local/sbin</LI>
<LI>copied the amavis-milter binary to /usr/local/sbin</LI>
<LI>created the /var/local/amavis directory with owner amavis and
mode 2700 or 0700</LI>
<LI>created a file named /etc/amavisd.conf</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Now you will need to create an alias in /etc/aliases or /etc/mail/aliases
(or wherever you keep your mail aliases) for the "
virusalert"
email
address that Amavis will try and send virus reports to. Generally,
this should be the system administrator.</P>
<P>Don't forget to rebuild the aliases file by issuing:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
newaliases
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Finally, open up the /etc/mail/sendmail.mc file for editing and
insert the following two lines anywhere after the line the begins
with "
## Custom configurations"
(it is near the bottom):</P>
<P>
<PRE>
define(`_FFR_MILTER', `1')dnl
INPUT_MAIL_FILTER(`milter-amavis', `S=local:/var/local/amavis/amavis-milter.sock, T=S:10m;R:10m;E:10m')dnl
</PRE>
</P>
<P>After you close the /etc/mail/sendmail.mc file, start-up amavis-milter
and amavisd with the following three commands:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
rm -rf /var/local/amavis/amavis-milter.sock
nohup /usr/local/sbin/amavis-milter -p /var/local/amavis/amavis-milter.sock &amp;
/usr/local/sbin/amavisd
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Now that Amavis is ready and running, you can fire-up your new
sendmail configuration with:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
sendmailconfig
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This command will recreate the /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file from
the /etc/mail/sendmail.mc file and reload the sendmail daemon. An
alternate approach is to delete the /etc/mail/sendmail.cf file, run
"
make"
in the /etc/mail directory, and restart sendmail with "
/etc/init.d/sendmail
restart"
(or whatever it is that you use).</P>
