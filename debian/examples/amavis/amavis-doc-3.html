<P>I am using a Linux commandline scanner from NAI Associates, Inc.
You will have to avail yourself of the documentation at 
<A HREF="http://www.amavis.org/"></A>
if you
don't know where to obtain a scanner. For example, you could place
your scanner binary along with its' data files in a directory named
"
/usr/local/share/av"
. Then create a symlink to the binary in the
"
/usr/local/bin"
directory. This way, the command to execute the
scanner is in your path, and the Amavis configure script will find
it. For a more advanced configuration (once you have the easy stuff
out of the way), take a look at the example start-stop script at
the end of this document.</P>
