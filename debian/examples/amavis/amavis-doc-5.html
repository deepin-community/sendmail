</H2>

<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As of October 23, 2001; the CVS copy might not compile. Skip
to the next section if you don't want to fool around. </BLOCKQUOTE>
Now that we have extracted the libmilter files, the next step
is to obtain the latest copy of the Amavis sourcecode. We will retrieve
this code from the Amavis CVS repository at 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/"></A>
. If you do not already
have the CVS package installed on your system, you can obtain it
with the command:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
apt-get install cvs
cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.amavis.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/amavis login
</PRE>
</P>
<P>You will be logging in anonymously, so just press enter at the
password prompt. If CVS gives you a hard time about "
$HOME/.cvspass"</P>
<P>not existing, then simply type:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
touch $HOME/.cvspass
</PRE>
</P>
<P>and issue the command once more. With these preliminaries out
of the way we can download the actual source with:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.amavis.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/amavis co amavis
</PRE>
</P>
<P>This will create a subdirectory named "
amavis"
in your temporary
directory. Please skip to section titled "
Building Amavis"
.</P>
<H2><A NAME="ss5.2">5.2</A> <A HREF="amavis-doc.html#toc5.2">If the CVS copy blows chunks</A>
</H2>

<P>If you are like me, and the CVS copy died hideously during "
./configure"
,
then download the the "
official"
CVS snapshot from 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/amavis/"></A>
. The available
version at the time of this writing was "
amavisd-snaphot-20010714"
.
You can dowload this as a tarball. Copy this file into your temporary
directory and run:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
tar zxf &lt;filename&gt;
</PRE>
</P>
<P>That should give you a nice directory of sourcecode.</P>
