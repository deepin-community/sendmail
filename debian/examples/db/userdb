#User names and the inbound(maildrop)/outbound(mailname) addresses
#dest machine/domain names must also be in sendmail.cG for masquerading
# NOTE: do NOT use FEATURE(stickyhost) with userdb
# NOTE: be carefull with local delivery, defeats plussed users
#
# NOTE: Combined with virtusertable and/or aliases, Genericstable
#       can do everything the userdb can and more (and the difference
#       is growing bigger). The userdb is basically obsolete.
