  * Have sendmail depend upon exact versions of -base,-cf, etc.
  * Add note in sendmail.mc about listening only on localhost   closes: #275896
  * Support debian/${SM_CONF}.patches subdirectory, with a structure
    like debian/patches (ie an 8.13/8.13.3 subdirectory) so that a
    site can have local patches that get copied (possibly replacing
    debian patches of the same name) and used.       closes: #291981
    NOTE: you'll have to refit these patches yourself, there's not much
    I can do automagically here...

    This, I think, completes the local customization setup, you can
    now have your own:
      - ${SM_CONF}.options   -- sendmail configuration options
      - ${SM_CONF}.changelog -- local changelog, prepended to the Debian log
      - ${SM_CONF}.patches   -- local patches

    Please, give it go and let me know what you think

      Usage: SM_CONF=Fubar debian/rules configure
      See debian/rules for more information
    + Move configuration options to debian/configure.options file
    + Add --with-custom=<custom> configure option to alter the version
      (ala make-kpkg).  --with-custom=Fubar will create a debian native
      package 'sendmail' with version 'Fubar.8.13.1-18'.  Lintian will
      mark the packages as in error because of the '-18', but no harm is
      otherwise caused.
    + Support <custom>.options to be used instead of configure.options
    + Support <custom>.changelog in the debian directory to be pre-pended
      to the standard changelog.  The format must match that of a stock
      changelog, and include a trailing empty line.
    + Support locally edited changelogs, though the prior <custom>.changelog
      is the preferred means.
    + Remove SM_BUILD_OPT=no{tls,auth} as they are now redundant

sendmail (8.13.1-8) unstable; urgency=high
  * Make initial install prompt free (by using a sane&safe default):
    + listen only to 127.0.0.1
    + if /etc/mailname extant, use it as the masquerade value
    + no smarthost (would have to prompt)
    + Issue msg to run sendmailconfig *later* if desired
    closes: #112397 #213022 #227464
  * Now lintian free (sans overrides and one message I can't get rid of):
    W: sendmail source: newer-standards-version 3.6.10.0
  * if HANDS_OFF != No, also remove /etc/cron.d/sendmail
  * remove empty NEWS files                              closes: #265977
  * Correct sasl2 instructions -                         closes: #265976
    Here's what you must do to make sasl usable with smtp/smmsp:
    + chown smmta:smmsp /etc/sasldb2  (problematic if used by others)
    + dpkg-statoverride --remove /var/run/saslauthd
    + dpkg-statoverride --add root sasl 711 /var/run/saslauthd

sendmail (8.13.1-7) unstable; urgency=high
  * LAST PACKAGE SPLIT FOR SARGE ...
    this is required to support those wish to install the minimum
    amount required to run sendmail (skipping rmail, sensible-mda, etc.)
    and is the final step all the other splits have been gearing up for!
    Post sarge, even sendmail-base should become optional
  * Create /etc/mail/access if one is not found -- enhanced security !
    especially since the newer sendmail.mc references it...
  * cleanup lintian somewhat - still have some 0-length files to deal with
  * stop update_notices from spewing crap
  * remove more cruft in the .diff.gz
  * mv {dialup,provider}.m4 to new m4 subdirectory and adjust sendmail.mc
  * cleanup and extend alternative support
  * added nodelay,terminate to ratecontrol
  * Add HANDS_OFF variable to sendmail.conf (the blood be upon your hands)
  * Make all new sendmailconfig installations listen to 127.0.0.1 by default
  * correct trap syntax in sendmailconfig

sendmail (8.13.0-2) unstable; urgency=high
  * <<<<====  This really needs to make sarge ====>>>>
    This brings a shared mail filter library to the package, making it
    much easier to package spam/ddos/etc. packages for sendmail - and
    yes, there a few just waiting in the wings.
  * The "sort some loose ends" update
  * Add the .mc file to the end of the .cf file - Just In Case...
  * Add _FFR_SKIP_DOMAINS (work by Stephen Frost)
  * Update received hdr format in hacks/virthost_by_ip.m4 to match current
    sendmail format
  * Tighten permissions on .db files to prevent local DOS (due to locks)
  * refresh feature/rhsbl.m4
  * update template sendmail.mc and access for some decent spam/DOS control
  * FINALLY... get rid of hoststats syslog errors iff $DAEMON_HOSTSTATS=No
  * /etc/mail/Makefile is cleaner & more robust
  * Newer pidfile handling in sendmail and scripts        closes: #123712
  * Fix new bash incompatability                          closes: #262211
  * RunAsUser support (not ready for prime-time yet)
    + add smmta uid/gid
    + sendmail.conf supports (doesn't yet document) DAEMON_RUNASUSER=No/yes
    + update_sys, update_mk, update_db change ownership appropriately
    still to go:
    + complete the sendmail.conf support (documentation)
    + document what must be changed
      + MAILER_FLAGS(local) -= S (can't change uid/gid)
      + chown smmta:sasl /etc/sasldb2
      + Must use SUID MDA (sensible-mda,procmail,mail.local)
      + set RunAsUser to smmta:smmsp in sendmail.mc
      + socket files (spamassassin, clamav, etc) need to be owned/writeable
        by smmta
      + *ALL* forward files, :include:, etc *MUST* be readable by the new
        smmta uid - or your mail *will* go *poof*
      + Summary: great for a mail bastion host, or a machine with a limited
        number of users - or well mannered users... otherwise - skip it !
  * Supply shared libmilter.o in a new package libmilter0 ! closes: #164282

sendmail (8.13.0-1) unstable; urgency=critical
  * <<<<====  This really needs to make sarge ====>>>>
    While a large update, and a version bump, it is critical that this
    makes it into sarge so that we have a clean migration path for the
    future and because of the enhance security features included in
    the upstream changes (leakage of confidential information) as well
    as numerous other items that protect the system from abuse (greet_pause)
  * New upstream version                             closes: #257483
  * Upstream patch for milter corrections
  * Refresh FAQ
  * Split out the arch independent portion of sendmail into new
    packages (sendmail-{base,cf}) and make sendmail depend upon them.
    This cuts down dramatically on the size of the sendmail .deb, and
    will reduce the space/time constraints on dbuilds.  It also gives
    a good start on co-existing MTAs (more on this later).  There may
    still be a few rough edges in the new packaging - just let me know!
  * Modernize the networking handling for sendmail:
    By setting up /etc/mail/sendmail.conf, you can tell sendmail to
    monitor one or more network interfaces for up/down status and
    reconfigure itself automatically - with no editting of scripts
    inside /etc/ppp/, /etc/network, or /etc/dhcp3.
      1) For ppp connections, the IPPARAM is for the file in /etc/mail/peers
      2) For dhcp connections, the dhcp provided domain name is used
      3) For ifup/down, you must add 'provider <name>' in the appropriate
         stanza for the interface (or use dns_domain ala resolvconf)
    Whenever /etc/resolv.conf is changed (resolvconf), sendmail's host
    status data will be refreshed to expedite the sending of any queued mail.
    * Add /etc/resolvconf/update-libc.d/sendmail
    * Add /etc/dhcp3/dhclient-exit-hooks.d/sendmail
    * Add /etc/network/if-{down,up}.d/sendmail
    * Add /usr/share/sendmail/dynamic
    * Update /etc/ppp/ip-{down,up}.d/sendmail
    * Update /usr/share/sendmail/update_conf and /etc/mail/sendmail.config
  * Add automake handling for the cf directories and expand its use
    in the examples, further simplifying the rules (more to go)
  * correct checksendmail's use of address.resolve (now in /etc/mail)
  * Improve dependancy relationships in /etc/mail/Makefile:
      *) databases depends upon {dialup,provider}.m4 and {sasl,starttls}.m4
      *) Parse_mc.pm also now scans those files
    This allows databases to also be defined in /etc/mail/peers/<...>
    and they will be recognized and updated accordingly.
    closes: #233288
  * Prevent debian-mta.m4 from overwriting DONT_BLAME_SENDMAIL
    NOTE WELL that the only correct way to start your sendmail.mc is:
      define(`_USE_ETC_MAIL_')dnl
      include(`/usr/share/sendmail/cf/m4/cf.m4')dnl
      VERSIONID(`$Id: sendmail.mc, v ... cowboy Exp $')
      OSTYPE(`debian')dnl
      DOMAIN(`debian-mta')dnl
    Placing ANYTHING before or in between this may BITE you !!!
    closes: #248802
  * rename /etc/logcheck/violations.ignore.d/logcheck.sendmail -> sendmail
    closes: #252560
